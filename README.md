# NFT Marketplace

## Project Overview

NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform that allows users to buy, sell, and trade Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. This platform offers users an easy and seamless experience for interacting with NFTs, powered by smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

The marketplace allows users to browse and purchase NFTs, list their own NFTs for sale, and manage their profiles, where they can view their purchased NFTs and personal information.
