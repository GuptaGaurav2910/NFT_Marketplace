# NFT Marketplace

## Project Overview

NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform that allows users to buy, sell, and trade Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. This platform offers users an easy and seamless experience for interacting with NFTs, powered by smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

The marketplace allows users to browse and purchase NFTs, list their own NFTs for sale, and manage their profiles, where they can view their purchased NFTs and personal information.

## Features

- **Marketplace View**: 
  - Browse through a collection of NFTs listed for sale.
  - View detailed information about each NFT.
  - Purchase NFTs directly from the marketplace.
  
- **Profile View**: 
  - Users can view their personal profile.
  - Display all the NFTs owned by the user.

- **Sell NFTs**:
  - List your NFTs for sale on the marketplace.
  - Set prices and descriptions for NFTs.

- **NFT Details Page**:
  - View detailed information of each NFT, including its metadata and price.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: 
  - **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the application.
  - **React Router**: For handling routing within the application.

- **Blockchain**:
  - **Solidity**: For writing smart contracts to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
  - **Hardhat**: A development environment for Ethereum smart contracts, used for testing and deploying the smart contracts.
  - **Ethers.js**: A library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

- **Other**:
  - **OpenZeppelin Contracts**: A library for secure smart contracts (e.g., ERC721 for NFTs).
